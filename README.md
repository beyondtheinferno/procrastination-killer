# Procrastination Killer
Every new tab you open, you get remind of how short life. A perfect motivation for getting your procrastinating lazy selves up and doing something productive or enjoying life more. Comes with a minimal mode for the minimalists.

## Why this works (atleast for me)
1. Remaining weeks is just the apt number for human brain to comprehend. Not too large (like hours / days) or not too short (like months, years).
2. The decrease in the remaining weeks happens gradually, giving our mind enough time to comprehend each passing week and plan anything for that week if and when the dread kicks in. Any other units would have resulted in either fast ticking clocks or really slow changes that don't let the dread kick in.
